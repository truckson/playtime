#BEER
# Can you make Python print out the song for 99 bottles of beer on the wall?

# Note: You can use range() in three different ways

# First:
# range(5) will give you a list containing [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
# In this case, range assumes you want to start counting at 0, and the parameter you give is the number to stop *just* short of.

# Second:
# range(5, 10) will give you a list containing [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
# In this case, the two parameters you give to range() are the number to start at and the number to stop *just* short of.
# Helpful mnemonic: range(start, stop)

# Third:
# range(5, 15, 3) will give you a list containing [5, 8, 11, 14]
# In this case, the three parameters you give to range() are the number to start at, the number to stop *just* short of, and the number to increment each time by.
# Note that normally, the number to increment each time by is assumed to be 1.  (In other words, you add 1 each time through.)
# That's why it goes [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] unless you specify that third parameter, called the step.
# Helpful mnemonic: range(start, stop, step)

# Using range() and a loop, print out the song.

#MOVIES
# Goal #1: Create a program that will print out a list of movie titles and a set of ratings defined below into a particular format.

# First, choose any five movies you want.
#"About a Boy"
#"Inside Llewyn Davis"
#"Motorcycle Diaries"
#""
# Next, look each movie up manually to find out four pieces of information:
#		Their parental guidance rating (G, PG, PG-13, R)
#		Their Bechdel Test Rating (See http://shannonvturner.com/bechdel or http://bechdeltest.com/)
#		Their IMDB Rating from 0 - 10 (See http://imdb.com/)
# 		Their genre according to IMDB

# After a few more lessons, you'll be able to tell Python to go out and get that information for you, but for now you'll have to collect it on your own.

# Now that you've written down each piece of information for all five of your movies, save them into variables.

# You'll need a variable for movie_titles, a variable for parental_rating, a variable for bechdel_rating, a variable for imdb_rating, and a variable for genre.

# Since you have five sets of facts about five movies, you'll want to use lists to hold these pieces of information.

# Once all of your information is stored in lists, loop through those lists to print out information with each part separated by a comma, like this:

# Example:
# Jurassic Park, PG-13, 3, 8.0, Adventure / Sci-Fi
# Back to the Future, PG, 1, 8.5, Adventure / Comedy / Sci-Fi

# Note how each piece of information is separated by a comma.  This is a specific file format called the "Comma Separated Value (CSV)" format
# If you can make a CSV file, you can open it up in Excel or Numbers as a spreadsheet.

# When you've printed out your information like the example above, copy/paste that into a file and save it as a .csv file.
# Open that up in Excel, Numbers, or another spreadsheet program.  How does it look?
